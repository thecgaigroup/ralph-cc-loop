  Iteration 1 of 10 - Sat Jan 10 15:32:29 EST 2026
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
All stories are complete. Since this is backlog mode and no eligible stories remain, I should output the BACKLOG_EMPTY signal.

**Summary of completed work:**

- **Story GH-1-1**: Add --version flag to ralph.sh
  - Added `VERSION="1.0.0"` variable at top of ralph.sh
  - Added handling for `--version` and `-v` flags (before dependency checks so it always works)
  - Updated help text to include the new flag
  - All acceptance criteria met and tested
  - Created PR #2: https://github.com/thecgaigroup/ralph-cc-loop/pull/2

  Iteration 1 of 10 - Sat Jan 10 16:28:36 EST 2026
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The story is marked as `passes: true`. All stories in this PRD have now passed.

Since this is backlog mode and there are no more eligible stories remaining (all are complete), I should signal `BACKLOG_EMPTY`:

<promise>BACKLOG_EMPTY</promise>

  Iteration 1 of 10 - Sat Jan 10 16:30:37 EST 2026
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
All stories have `passes: true`. In backlog mode with no remaining eligible stories, I should signal completion.

**Summary:**

I successfully implemented story **GH-4-1: Add --dry-run flag to ralph.sh**

**Changes made:**
- Added `show_dry_run()` function that displays PRD information without executing
- Added `--dry-run` command handler after the status handler
- Updated help text to include the new option
- Created PR #5: https://github.com/thecgaigroup/ralph-cc-loop/pull/5

**Acceptance criteria verified:**
- ✅ `./ralph.sh --dry-run [project]` shows parsed PRD info
- ✅ Displays: project name, mode, number of stories, eligible stories
- ✅ Lists each story with id, title, and passes status
- ✅ Does NOT start Claude Code or make any changes
- ✅ Exit cleanly after printing (exit code 0)
